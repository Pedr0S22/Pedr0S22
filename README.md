<h1 align="left">Hello there!ðŸ‘‹</h1>

###

<p align="left">I'm Pedro Silva, a Data Science and Engineering student from Coimbra, Portugal. I'm currently entering the 3rd year of my Bachelor's, where I explore how to solve real-world problems through code, data, and systems thinking.</p>

<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">âœ¨ I started my programming journey 3 years ago with C and the CS50 Harvard course, and began my Bachelor's in Data Science and Engineering 2 years ago.<br><br>ðŸ“š I'm currently learning how to build modern APIs in Java using the Spring Boot framework and NoSQL databases (MongoDB). I'm also exploring Spring Security, JWT tokens, and encryption through my MovieQuest project. On top of that, I'm strengthening my PostgreSQL skills and aiming to dive into new technologies like AWS S3 and Snowflake for data engineering. <br><br>ðŸŽ¯ My goals: Learn something new every day and build a strong portfolio to land my first full-time job after university.</p>

<h2 align="left">What I'm Passionate About</h2>

###

ðŸ’¡ I'm especially interested in Data Science, Data Engineering, and Backend Development. These areas allow me to combine technical skills with problem-solving to build meaningful solutions.

- **Why Data Science?**  
  Because I enjoy Maths, Statistics, and Programming and data science is the perfect intersection of all three. I love solving modern real-world problems through data-driven solutions.

- **Why Data Engineering?**  
  This interest grew during my Bachelor's. I learned how important it is to understand and build ETL/ELT pipelines to prepare data for Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.

- **Why Backend Development?**  
  My passion for backend emerged from subjects like Distributed Systems and Database Management. What excites me most is implementing business logic and designing robust systems that solve real problems efficiently.
